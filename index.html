<h1>The Eagle and the Arrow</h1>
<p>An Eagle was soaring through the air when suddenly it heard the whizz of an Arrow, and felt itself wounded to death. Slowly it fluttered down to the earth, with its life-blood pouring out of it. <p>Looking down upon the Arrow with which it had been pierced, it found that the shaft of the Arrow had been feathered with one of its own plumes.</p> <p>"Alas!" it cried, as it died,
"We often give our enemies the means for our own destruction."</p>

<h3>The Fox and the Mask</h3>
<p>A Fox had by some means got into the store-room of a theatre. <p>Suddenly he observed a face glaring down on him and began to be very frightened; but looking more closely he found it was only a Mask such as actors use to put over their face.</p>
<p>"Ah," said the Fox, "you look very fine; it is a pity you have not got any brains."
Outside show is a poor substitute for inner worth.

      <h1>THE LION AND THE STATUE</h1>
      <p>A Man and a Lion were discussing the relative strength of men and lions in general. The Man contended that he and his fellows were stronger than lions by reason of their greater intelligence. </p> <p>"Come now with me," he cried, "and I will soon prove that I am right." So he took him into the public gardens and showed him a statue of Hercules overcoming the Lion and tearing his mouth in two.
    </p> <p>  "That is all very well," said the Lion, "but proves nothing, for it was a man who made the statue."
      <p>  We can easily represent things as we wish them to be.</p>
